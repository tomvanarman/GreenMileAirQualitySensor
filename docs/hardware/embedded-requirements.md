# Embedded requirements

## Introduction
These are the embedded requirements for the Climate Measuring Box (CMB). The CMB is an embedded device that measures environmental data and sends it to a backend server for analysis and visualization. The device needs to be designed to operate in outdoor conditions and be able to connect to the internet using LTE.

These requirements have been gathered from meetings with our client.

## Requirements

- It needs to measure environmental data such as air quality, temperature and humidity using various sensors.
- It must be able to connect to the internet using LTE to send the collected data to a backend server.
- It should be able to read it's battery status and report low battery levels.
- It must be able to operate in outdoor conditions, including being water-resistant.
- It should be able to operate for extended periods on battery power, with efficient power management
- It must be able to save up data locally in case of connectivity issues and transmit it once the connection is restored.
