# LifePo4

## Introduction
The Wonder board will use a LifePo4 battery as it's main power source. It has a lot of advantages over traditional Li-Ion batteries like safety, temperature and life span. In this document I will explain the basics of LifePo4 batteries and compare it to Li-Ion.

## Basics of LiFePo4
LiFePo4 batteries are a type of rechargeable battery that uses lithium iron phosphate as the cathode material. They are known for their high energy density, long cycle life, and safety compared to other lithium-ion batteries.

The biggest differences between LiFePo4 and traditional Li-Ion batteries are:
* **Voltage** : LiFePo4 batteries have a nominal voltage of 3.2V per cell, while Li-Ion batteries typically have a nominal voltage of 3.7V per cell. So they cannot be used interchangeably without considering the voltage difference.
* **Working temperature** : LiFePo4 batteries can operate in a wider temperature range (-20°C to 60°C) compared to Li-Ion batteries (0°C to 45°C). This makes them more suitable for applications in extreme environments.
